    <div class="periodical"><em>Nature Human Behaviour</em> (2023)</div>
        <div class="abstract">In a large-sample pre-registered online experiment, participants were randomly assigned to receive information about the journal <i>Nature</i>'s political endorsement. The informational treatment substantially reduced and polarized confidence in <i>Nature</i> and the scientific community among participants, and the behavioral impacts of this belief update includes 38.3% lower demand for public health information attributed to <i>Nature</i>. </div>

    <div class="periodical"><i>Under review</i></div>
    <div class="abstract">We theoretically study how selective exposure to information affects electoral competition and policy polarization by analyzing a Calvert-Wittman probabilistic voting model in which voters only receive valence information slanted to confirm their predispositions. Contrary to predictions of existing work, we show that it reduces policy polarization relative to a benchmark where voters all consume information from a neutral source. The result is robust to non-Bayesian voters who are systematically manipulated by biased signals. </div>

    <div class="title"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Rage Against the Merchant: The Effect of Job Automation on Trade Protection</span></div>
        <div class="abstract"> Using a shift-share instrumental variable exploiting differential penatration of industrial robot across industries, I find suggestive causal evidence that U.S. House members representing labor markets more exposed to automation vote for more restrictive trade policies. The magnitude of the effect of robots on protectionism is quantitatively similar to experiencing an import shock of comparably large labor market impact. This effect is driven by incumbent response instead of electoral selection and is more pronounced in low-information media markets. I interpret the results as systematic misattribution of labor market disruption but also discuss caveats concerning the interpretation and the IV strategy.  </div>

    <div class="title"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Nationalism and Preferences for Redistribution in Autocracies: The Opioid of the Masses?</span></div>
        <div class="abstract"> Why do autocrats promote nationalism? I present a simple model of endogenous identity formation in a stylized autocratic political economy where distributive conflicts are resolved by the threat of revolution. I show that the salience of national identity reduces citizen demand for income redistribution and political power, and that the structural parameters can be identified econometrically with a random utility model and a factorial survey experiment. Equilibrium implications of these behavioral predictions for growth and inequality are derived and discussed in relations to existing work on redistribution, authoritarian growth and control. </div>
