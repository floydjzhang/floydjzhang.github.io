## About Me

I am an economist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work on micro-economics and algorithms at Instacart, where I am an economist and machine learning engineer. Prior to Instacart, I received my PhD from Stanford University's Graduate School of Business in 2022, where I researched the economics of political institutions and behaviors. I have also studied at the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia, earning a bachelor's and a master's degree in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
